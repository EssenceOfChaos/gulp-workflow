# Gulp-Workflow

Standard task-management for **Sass preprocessing**, **Coffee script transpiling**, **automatic browser reload**, and some other standard lightweight automation.


* The variables, mixins, and custom partials are all imported to main.scss
* All .sass and .scss extentions will be processed into *public/assets/main.css*
* Run npm install to download the package.json dependencies and 'gulp' to run the task manager. The setup is preconfigured to be simple and easy to use
